1. Introduction to OOP
- What is Object-Oriented Programming?
- Benefits of OOP in C++
- Procedural vs Object-Oriented Paradigm
2. Basic Building Blocks
- Classes and Objects
- Access Specifiers: public, private, protected
- Member Variables and Member Functions
- this Pointer
3. Constructors and Destructors
- Default Constructor
- Parameterized Constructor
- Copy Constructor
- Constructor Overloading
- Destructor and its role
4. Encapsulation
- Data Hiding
- Getters and Setters
- Real-world examples
5. Inheritance
- Types of Inheritance:
- Single
- Multiple
- Multilevel
- Hierarchical
- Hybrid
- protected vs private inheritance
- Constructor chaining in inheritance
- Function Overriding
6. Polymorphism
- Compile-time Polymorphism:
- Function Overloading
- Operator Overloading
- Runtime Polymorphism:
- Virtual Functions
- Pure Virtual Functions
- Abstract Classes
- virtual keyword and vtable
